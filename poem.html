        <h1>At the Window</h1>
        <h2>DH Lawrence</h2>
        <p>The pine-trees bend to listen to the autumn wind as it
       mutters <br/>
       Something which sets the black poplars ashake with hysterical
       laughter; <br/>
       While slowly the house of day is closing its eastern shutters.
       </p>
       <p>Further down the valley the clustered tombstones recede,
       <br/>
       Winding about their dimness the mist's grey cerements, after
       <br/>
       The street lamps in the darkness have suddenly started to
       bleed. </p>
       <p>The leaves fly over the window and utter a word as they pass
       <br/>
       To the face that leans from the darkness, intent, with two
       dark-filled eyes<br/>
       That watch for ever earnestly from behind the window glass.
